            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</li>
            <li>Whisk melted butter, brown sugar, white sugar, salt, and nutmeg  together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Add in egg and vanilla and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Add in flour and baking soda and mix until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips, M&Ms, and sprinkles.</li>
            <li>Transfer batter into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle a few more chocolate chips, M&Ms, and sprinkles evenly over the top of the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bars are puffed and begin to turn golden brown on top, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven; cool completely before cutting into bars.</li>
